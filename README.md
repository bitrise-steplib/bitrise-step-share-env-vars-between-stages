## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<details>
<summary>Inputs</summary>

| Key | Description | Flags | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `variables` | A newline (`\n`) separated list of key - value pairs (`{key}={value}`).  The input uses a `{key}={value}` syntax. The first equals sign (`=`) is the delimiter between the key and value of the environment variable. A shorthand syntax of `ENV_KEY` can be used for `ENV_KEY=$ENV_KEY` when sharing an existing environment variable (ENV_KEY).  Examples: ``` MY_ENV_KEY=my value EXISTING_ENV_KEY ``` | required |  |
| `app_url` | The app's URL on Bitrise.io. | required | `$BITRISE_APP_URL` |
| `build_slug` | The build's slug on Bitrise.io. | required | `$BITRISE_BUILD_SLUG` |
| `build_api_token` | API Token for the build on Bitrise.io. | required, sensitive | `$BITRISE_BUILD_API_TOKEN` |
