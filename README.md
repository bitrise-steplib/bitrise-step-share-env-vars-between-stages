<summary>Description</summary>

Share environment variables between Pipeline Stages.

Variables shared by the Step will be available in subsequent stages workflow's as [one-off env vars](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/environment-variables.html#setting-a-custom-env-var-when-starting-a-build) as if provided manually on the website.

## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).

### Example

```yaml
steps:
- script@1:
    title: Should we run UI tests?
    inputs:
    - content: |-
        set -eo pipefail
        # Custom logic goes here
        envman add --key RUN_UI_TESTS --value true
- share-pipeline-variable@1:
    title: Configure next pipeline stage
    inputs:
    - variables: |-
        RUN_UI_TESTS
        BUILD_TYPE=debug
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<details>
<summary>Inputs</summary>

| Key | Description | Flags | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `variables` | A newline (`\n`) separated list of variable names or `NEW_ENV=NEW_VALUE` for declaring new variables.  The input uses a `KEY=VALUE` syntax for declaring new variables. The first `=` is the delimiter between the key and value of the environment variable. A shorthand syntax of `ENV_KEY` can be used for `ENV_KEY=$ENV_KEY` when sharing an existing environment variable (ENV_KEY).  Examples: ``` MY_ENV_VAR=my value EXISTING_ENV_VAR ``` | required |  |
| `app_url` | The app's URL on Bitrise.io. | required | `$BITRISE_APP_URL` |
| `build_slug` | The build's slug on Bitrise.io. | required | `$BITRISE_BUILD_SLUG` |
| `build_api_token` | API Token for the build on Bitrise.io. | required, sensitive | `$BITRISE_BUILD_API_TOKEN` |
